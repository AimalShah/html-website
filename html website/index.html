    <h1>Bill Gates</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <p> <b> William Henry Gates III</b> (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer,
        investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul
        Allen.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer
        (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May
        2014.[4] He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955.[3] He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b]
        (1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[22] His ancestry includes English, German, and
        Irish/Scots-Irish.[23] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for
        First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a
        national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the
        fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father
        had the "II" suffix.[24][25] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a
        rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[26]

        Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.[27] When he was young, his
        family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed
        denomination.[28][29][30] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.[25] The family encouraged
        competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the
        dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[31]</p>

    <h3><em>Microsoft</em></h3>

    <br>
    <p>Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted
        Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC
        interpreter for the platform.[54] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code
        for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a
        demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer,
        and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was
        a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[55]
        and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their
        partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in
        Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[55] They
        dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the
        State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.[55] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.</p>

        <h4><b>Windows</b></h4>
        <p>Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an
            attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had bewitched consumers with its
            simplicity and ease of use.[69] In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to
            develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first
            version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[70] The
            operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade, until with Windows 95 the DOS text
            screen was relegated to the closet. Windows XP, released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO,
            reportedly was the first to not be based on DOS.[71] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released
            before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W. Thompson on February 5, 2014.[72]</p>
